### Oh, you mean for programming language?
Python: 8/10. I have been working mostly in Python in both my job as well as personal project, and I am now fairly confident in it. \
R, SQL, SAS: 7/10. \
Web: 3/10 (unless you count R shiny in). Have basic knowledge on how html, css and javascript works together. \

I also have superficial knowledge on LaTeX (if you consider them as a programming langugage in the first place). My current resume is in fact built using LaTeX so I guess it is not too bad?
