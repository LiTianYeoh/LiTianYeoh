## Education
### BSc Degree with First Class Honour in Mathematics. Imperical College London, Year 2021
<ul>
  <li> Solid understanding in basic concepts including:
    <ol> 
      <li> real and complex analysis,  </li>
      <li> algebra, </li>
      <li> calculus, </li>
      <li> metric spaces and topology, </li>
      <li>probability and statistics. </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> Studied courses on numerical analysis and differential equation.  </li>
</ul>

### Currently studying in Master in Data Science in the University of Malaya.

## Work Experience
None.

## Language Proficiency
English: 8/10. Best at writing, decent in both reading and speaking. \
Chinese: 7/10 and decreasing. Still good in reading and speaking but getting more and more terrible in writing :sweat_smile:. \
Malay: 5/10, just sufficient for daily use.

### Oh, you mean for programming language?
Python, R, Matlab: 7/10. \
Web: 3/10 (unless you count R shiny in). Have basic knowledge on how html, css and javascript works together. \
:point_up_2: That is if I am allowed to google search for the syntax. If not, -5 for all of them :joy:. 

I also have superficial knowledge on SQL and LaTeX (if you consider them as a programming langugage in the first place).
I should be able to pick up most programming language quickly as I strongly believe that coding is about the thought process and algorithm 
instead of what line exactly we need to type out.

## Online Course Taken
I joined edX as a preparation to transform from the field of mathematics into data science. I went through most of the courses in the Data Science Professional Certificate Program by HarvardX (with no certificate because I am poor :neutral_face:), as well as some courses on computer science. I also took the Data Science Ethics course by MichiganX as a requirement to my study of Master in Data Science in the UM.
